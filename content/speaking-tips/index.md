For many years, I've quietly mentored a few speakers in the industry. As I slow down my own speaking career, I've decided to put some of that mentoring advice into Internet form. I've seen numerous speakers bring notes to themselves up to the podium, and reference them during the presentation.

This is a collection of tips that I have written in the past as a way to help new speakers (and old) find their way more easily within the public technical speaking circles (conferences and the like).
