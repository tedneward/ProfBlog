description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is when the manager must run every decision past their manager.

"Hey boss, can we use this new library for the project?"  "Hmm, not sure, let me check with the VP."  "Hey boss, can we move to a more agile development process for our library?"  "Great question, let me ask."  "Hey boss, what do you want on your pizza?"  "You know, let me run that up the flagpole...." The Flagpole Manager, for whatever reason, refuses to make any decision on their own, preferring instead to pass everything to somebody above them instead.

***Context:***

In many respects, management is there to make decisions that the team either cannot, will not, or doesn't have the broader perspective to effectively make. Decisions are a fact of life in any software development team, and if the decisions aren't made in a timely fashion, the team is hamstrung (if not crippled entirely) in their ability to deliver on their expectations.

However, as many the employee has learned, "You can be many things at this company, but the one thing you cannot be is wrong." Making a decision that costs the company money, time, or even just a hit to their reputation can all result in termination, and regardless of the state of the tech labor market, nobody really wants to be fired. (Leave on our own terms? Totally different story. But fired, even when we were planning to quit tomorrow? No thank you.)

And given the degree of complexity that sometimes accompany these decisions, making a decision is often not an easy thing, particularly when [so many of them are more in the nature of a bet](./some-decisions-are-bets.md) than a logical evaluation. In fact, as a general rule, managerial decisions are hard because if they were easy, somebody below you would've already made it!
