description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is to make your tech lead a manager.

"Avi is having problems getting the team following his technical design decisions, so let's make him the manager of the team. That way he can put some weight behind his decisions and make sure they follow them." While it's always tempting to take the tech lead of the project and put them into a management role, it almost always backfires, as it now puts a huge additional burden (that of managing people!) onto an individual who's likely already running out of hours in the day, particularly if they're squarely in the critical path for feature development.

***Variants:*** 

* **The Architect Manager:** At some point, an architect gets frustrated if the team doesn't follow the guidance and "standards" they've created, and start to demand some kind of enforcement authority. The natural next step, of course, is to promote them (often into the CTO role) so that they have some modicum of authority to "enforce the architecture" but without any real clear guidance as to how, when, or with what kinds of corrective action available. (Think about it for a second: Is the company really ready to fire an otherwise-productive senior engineer just because they refuse to use the architect's naming conventions? Or suggested designs?) Considering that architecture in any company larger than 10 people is likely to be its own full-time job anyway, promoting the architect into a management role is only going to create the same pressure on the Architect Manager as the others in this antipattern.
