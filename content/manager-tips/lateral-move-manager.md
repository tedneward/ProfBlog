description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is when a manager comes over from an entirely different part of the company.

"Hey, Susan? Look, I just talked with Bob, and he's getting antsy, talking about quitting and going someplace else." "Really? Well, we don't want to lose him to the company, but there's nothing above him in the org chart that's open." "Well, what if we slide him over into Vlad's old role over on the Atlas team?" "Well... Does Bob know anything about Atlas?" "Nah, but he's a smart guy, he'll figure it out."

The lateral-move manager is the manager who gets put in charge of a team because the company wants to retain them, but can't move them higher up in the branch of the org tree they were in. Fearing the loss of smart people, the company "promotes" them into a lateral role, usually in an entirely different part of the company. For the company, (at best) it's a chance to buy some "breathing room" to figure out where to promote this individual; for the individual, (at best) it's not the best promotion in the world, but it is a way to "learn more about the business" and/or "prove my promotional possibilities". And that's assuming that both parties are taking the best path they can with this; it relies on the best of intentions and behavior from the company, and the best of interpretations from the individual.

***Context:*** 

There's a couple of things at work here:

* **Limited vertical opportunities.** As much as companies would love to make every employee's "move" within the company an upward-angled one (moving to a higher layer of the org chart), the practical fact is that companies often don't have openings in the right places to make that possible. It's sheer numbers--if each team is 5-7 people, led by one manager, and the manager above them is keeping track of 3-5 teams.... Well, it doesn't take a PhD in maths to figure out where that's going. Even with an IC career track, you still run into numbers: Even if we discount the numbers of developers who never want a promotion, and the numbers of developers who are willing to go up the IC track (assuming your company has one), you still have typically 2 or 3 developers per team who are interested in management.

* **Unlimited desire for advancement.** Really smart people want to improve their standing at the company, which for mean means a move up the org chart. But if the company doesn't have that opening directly "above" them, those really smart people may choose to put on their walking shoes and find another company that does.
