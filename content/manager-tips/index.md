Since around 2012, I've been hanging up my keyboard (as an architect, developer, and individual contributor) to take on more management roles. I've learned quite a few things along the way, both first-hand, from observation up close, and from seeing at a distance, and I thought it a good idea to start sharing.

* ["Management Lessons for Developers"](../blog/2007/management-lessons-for-developers.html)
* ["Hire the Fired"](../blog/2016/hire-the-fired.html)
* ["Happy People Still Do Quit"](../blog/2016/happy-people-still-do-quit.html)
* ["Maybe is Selfish"](../blog/2016/maybe-is-selfish.html)
* ["The Value of Failure"](../blog/2016/the-value-of-failure.html)
* ["When interviews fail"](../blog/2016/when-interviews-fail.html)
* ["There is no such thing as 'best practices'"](../blog/2005/there-is-no-such-thing-as-best-practices-context-matters.html)
* ["The power of teams"](../blog/2024/the-power-of-teams.html)
* ["An Engineering Manager Challenge"](../blog/2024/engineering-manager-challenge.html)

I've found a few principles to be true across my various managerial positions. Some of these I've shamelessly borrowed/leveraged/stolen from other places I've worked or from people I've worked with/for, but some are all me. (You can probably figure out which ones are which if you really want to.)

* ["There's No Such Thing as 'Best Practice'"; or, "Context Matters"](../blog/2005/there-is-no-such-thing-as-best-practices-context-matters.html)
* ["Credibility is Currency"](./credibility-is-currency.html)
* ["Good Fences Make Good Neighbors"](./good-fences-good-neighbors.html)
* "Actions Speak Louder than Words"
* "Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast" *(Peter Drucker's famous maxim still holds, almost a century later)*
* "Culture Cannot be Managed, Hired, or Bought; Only Exhibited" *(I think Drucker knew this intuitively, and didn't realize some people would think culture meant "posters in the break room")*
* "No Battle Plan Survives First Contact (With the Enemy)"
* "Never Mistake Activity for Progress"
* "Eat Your Own Dog Food" *(Microsoft, I think, coined this phrase back when they would force internal employees to use pre-release copies of Windows in order to get some real-world experience with it before it hit the streets)*
* "We'll Figure It Out"
* "Numbers And Money Follow; They Do Not Lead" *(This one I very deliberately swipe from Rocket Mortgage; it's such a refreshing take, and coming from bankers, to boot!)*
* "Simplicity is Genius... and Difficult" *(Rocket understood the first part, but commonly missed the second part)*
* "Practice Makes Perfect" *(You get more success out of twenty fast experiments/iterations than one large swipe at perfection)*

I also find a few management antipatterns to which too many companies fall victim:

* ["We need a unanimous consensus to move on"](./consensus.html)
* ["You can be many things here... except wrong"](./paranoia-of-wrong.html)

... and there's a few "manager antipatterns":

* ["The Absentee Manager"](./absentee-manager.html): "What manager?"
* ["The Bomb Manager"](./bomb-manager.html): "We need to toss it all and start over."
* ["The C-Buddy Manager"](./c-buddy-manager.html): "Hey all, this is my buddy Tony, and he's going to be taking over the team as a favor to me."
* ["The Funnel Manager"](./funnel-manager.html): "Wait until you hear what my boss told me today!"
* ["The Hammer Manager"](./hammer-manager.html): "I only know how to use a hammer, so I'm going to hammer away with it"
* ["The Headless Chicken Manager"](./hlc-manager.html): "OMG OMG OMG I don't know what to do OMG OMG OMG"
* ["The Laissez-Faire Manager"](./laissez-faire-manager.html): "I'm going to be the opposite of a micromanager, and leave them totally alone"
* ["The Lateral-Move Manager"](./lateral-move-manager.html): "Let's take a manager from one group and move them to run a team in a totally different area of the company"
* ["The Perfectionist Manager"](./perfectionist-manager.html): "Hey, it's MY team, so the work isn't done until I think it's perfect."
* ["The Smartest-Engineer Manager"](./smartest-engineer-manager.html): "Let's promote the smartest engineer on the team to manager"
* ["The Sphinx Manager"](./sphinx-manager.html): "Riddle me this...."
* ["The Tech-Lead Manager"](./tech-lead-manager.html): "Let's just have a developer be a manager and a developer at the same time"
<!-- 
* ["The Documentation-Abuse Manager"](./doc-abuse-manager.html): "If it isn't in the spec, written down, or otherwise documented, it didn't or doesn't happen."
* ["The Flagpole Manager"](./flagpole-manager.html): "I don't want to make any sort of decision, ever, so I'm going to pass this up the flagpole"
* ["The Metric-Abuse Manager"](./metric-abuse-manager.html): "Well, we are a data-driven company, so I'm going to overindex on the data part of that." 
* ["The Project-Manager Manager"](./pm-manager.html): "Let's put the project manager in charge so they can crack the whip as necessary"
