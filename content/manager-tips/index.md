Since around 2012, I've been hanging up my keyboard (as an architect, developer, and individual contributor) to take on more management roles. I've learned quite a few things along the way, both first-hand, from observation up close, and from seeing at a distance, and I thought it a good idea to start sharing.

* ["Management Lessons for Developers"](../blog/2007/management-lessons-for-developers.html)
* ["Hire the Fired"](../blog/2016/hire-the-fired.html)
* ["Happy People Still Do Quit"](../blog/2016/happy-people-still-do-quit.html)
* ["Maybe is Selfish"](../blog/2016/maybe-is-selfish.html)
* ["The Value of Failure"](../blog/2016/the-value-of-failure.html)
* ["When interviews fail"](../blog/2016/when-interviews-fail.html)
* ["There is no such thing as 'best practices'"](../blog/2005/there-is-no-such-thing-as-best-practices-context-matters.html)
* ["The power of teams"](../blog/2024/the-power-of-teams.html)
* ["An Engineering Manager Challenge"](../blog/2024/engineering-manager-challenge.html)

I've found a few principles to be true across my various managerial positions:

* ["Credibility is Currency"](./credibility-is-currency.md)
* ["Good Fences Make Good Neighbors"](./good-fences-good-neighbors.md)

There's also a few "manager antipatterns" I've noticed companies and managers fall prey to, which I've collected here:

* ["The Absentee Manager"](./absentee-manager.md): "What manager?"
* ["The Bomb Manager"](./bomb-manager.md): "We need to toss it all and start over."
* ["The C-Buddy Manager"](./c-buddy-manager.md): "Let's put a buddy of the CxO's in charge of the team"
* ["The Documentation-Abuse Manager"](./doc-abuse-manager.md): "If it isn't in the spec, written down, or otherwise documented, it didn't or doesn't happen."
* ["The Flagpole Manager"](./flagpole-manager.md): "I don't want to make any sort of decision, ever, so I'm going to pass this up the flagpole"
* ["The Funnel Manager"](./funnel-manager.md): "Wait until you hear what my boss told me today!"
* ["The Hammer Manager"](./hammer-manager.md): "I only know how to use a hammer, so I'm going to hammer away with it"
* ["The Headless Chicken Manager"](./hlc-manager.md): "OMG OMG OMG I don't know what to do OMG OMG OMG"
* ["The Laissez-Faire Manager"](./laissez-faire-manager.md): "I'm going to be the opposite of a micromanager, and leave them totally alone"
* ["The Lateral-Move Manager"](./lateral-move-manager.md): "Let's take a manager from one group and move them to run a team in a totally different area of the company"
* ["The Metric-Abuse Manager"](./metric-abuse-manager.md): "Well, we are a data-driven company, so I'm going to overindex on the data part of that."
* ["The Perfectionist Manager"](./perfectionist-manager.md): "Hey, it's MY team, so the work isn't done until I think it's perfect."
* ["The Project-Manager Manager"](./pm-manager.md): "Let's put the project manager in charge so they can crack the whip as necessary"
* ["The Smartest-Engineer Manager"](./smartest-engineer-manager.md): "Let's promote the smartest engineer on the team to manager"
* ["The Sphinx Manager"](./sphinx-manager.md): "Riddle me this...."
* ["The Tech-Lead Manager"](./tech-lead-manager.md): "Let's just have a developer be a manager and a developer at the same time"

I also find a few management antipatterns in way too many companies:

* [Decisions by Unanimous Consensus](./consensus.md)
* [Paranoia of Wrong](./paranoia-of-wrong.md)

The full collection of ["management" tags](/tags/management.html) has a few more posts.
