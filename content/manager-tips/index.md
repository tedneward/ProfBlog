Since around 2012, I've been hanging up my keyboard (as an architect, developer, and individual contributor) to take on more management roles. I've learned quite a few things along the way, both first-hand, from observation up close, and from seeing at a distance, and I thought it a good idea to start sharing.

* ["Management Lessons for Developers"](../blog/2007/management-lessons-for-developers.html)
* ["Hire the Fired"](../blog/2016/hire-the-fired.html)
* ["Happy People Still Do Quit"](../blog/2016/happy-people-still-do-quit.html)
* ["Maybe is Selfish"](../blog/2016/maybe-is-selfish.html)
* ["The Value of Failure"](../blog/2016/the-value-of-failure.html)
* ["When interviews fail"](../blog/2016/when-interviews-fail.html)
* ["There is no such thing as 'best practices'"](../blog/2005/there-is-no-such-thing-as-best-practices-context-matters.html)
* ["The power of teams"](../blog/2024/the-power-of-teams.html)
* ["An Engineering Manager Challenge"](../blog/2024/engineering-manager-challenge.html)

There's also a few "manager antipatterns" I've noticed companies and managers fall prey to, which I've collected here:

* ["The Smartest-Engineer Manager"](./smartest-engineer-manager.md)
* ["The Tech-Lead Manager"](./tech-lead-manager.md)
* The Project-Manager Manager
* The Lateral-Move Manager
* The Laissez-Faire Manager
* The C-Buddy Manager
* The Hammer Manager
* The Pass-Through Manager
* The Absentee Manager
* The Headless Chicken Manager
* The Metric-Abuse Manager
* The Documentation-Abuse Manager

I also find a few management antipatterns in way too many companies:

* [Decisions by Unanimous Consensus](./consensus.md)
