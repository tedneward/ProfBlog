description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is the manager whose task is to fix a team--and blow it up to do so.
~~~~~~

"He's doing WHAT?" "Yup, you heard me, he scrapped all the code reviews, canceled the migration work, and has us all starting this new project that he thinks is 'super-pumped'." "But what did you say when he asked why we were doing the migration work?" "He never asked...." The Bomb manager, upon being given a team that has "a few problems", comes in and within a very short period of time (sometimes weeks, sometimes days) has an immediate plan of action which primarily consists of "blowing it all up" and either starting over, doing something entirely different, or putting the pieces back together themselves.

***Context:*** 

The Bomb manager, also sometimes called a Wrecking Ball manager, is warned (either officially or unofficially through the rumor mill) that their new team has low morale. So they come in looking for issues to fix. As is inevitable, right away, they find some. Wanting to look decisive and determined, they immediately institute changes to the team's processes and/or work schedule, disrupting the *status quo* and demanding adoption of the new decisions.

Sometimes this is because the Bomb has a reputation for determined and decisive leadership--it is not uncommon for a manager who has success leading a high-performance team to be given a new, lower-performing, team in the hopes that whatever "magic" they worked with the first team can be repeated with this one. They may even get to bring a member or two from their old team over to the new one, and it is a given that the new team does things differently than the old, both in terms of the processes (formal and informal) and culture within the team, as well as technology choices or work partitioning. The Bomb not only has a notion of what worked well (from the old team) but also finds that they have something of a reputation to protect--and the feeling of eyes on them as they take on the new team. Even if nothing of the sort is said out loud, there is a tacit pressure to "deliver results immediately".

***Consequences:*** 

Ironically, blowing things up isn't the problem--sometimes, things need to be blown up or some other kind of radical engagement is necessary. The larger problem is around the lack of input from the team and/or their partners/clients.

* **Team dynamics suffer.** Not consulting the team for their input or even just their opinions. The Bomb's sweeping changes leave people frustrated, slighted for their lack of input (despite their first-hand experience with the problem), and unappreciated. Morale suffers, and the decisive steps now look like ignorant flailing.

* **The Bomb's credibility suffers.** Brought in to the team to fix things, the Bomb's decisions now seem wholly naive and inappropriate, costing the manager the one thing they desperately need in any kind of fix-it situation: credibility. Without some kind of immediate rectification, the Bomb will likely need to be transferred back out of that role before long.

***Mitigation:*** 

The Bomb needs to learn a little philosophy, before anything else.

In philosophy this concept (that things are the way they are for a reason) is often known as [Lord Chesteron's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/): 

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

The original "lore" behind the idea is that of a nobleman who rode out into a field to see a fence bisecting the field for no apparent reason. Annoyed that the fence marred the otherwise glorious beauty of an open field, he ordered the fence destroyed. The next day, he woke up to find his cattle had wandered through the now-fenceless field into his garden, destroying it utterly.

Those things that seem like they need blowing up? Sometimes they're that way for a reason. It turns out the migration would have resolved issues that have frustrated the team for years. Senior engineers on the team had instituted the approval process after multiple disastrous outages. 

Rescuing a Bomb can be tricky and difficult, and sometimes not worth the effort.

* **Apologize, immediately and profusely.** The Bomb needs to go in front of the team and apologize for their hasty actions. This is a necessary first step to rebuilding the credibility of the manager with their team. This cannot be a "mistakes were made" sort of apology, either; the Bomb must stand up, look each of the team in the eye and say, "I was wrong. I thought I understood why these changes would work, but I clearly didn't know as much as I thought I did, and I should have asked all of you to help with my assessment before arriving at a conclusion and pronouncing solutions."

* **Engage the team in a re-assessment.** The Bomb also needs to bring the team in to the assessment of the current state so as to gain not just their insight, but their emotional investment into rebuilding the team culture and improving morale. It may turn out that the fixes/solutions are much closer to the Bomb's original plans than anyone had thought, but now that the whole team (and any prospective partners or clients) has had a chance to weigh in with perspective and input, they can all take equal pride.

* **Take little to no credit for the changes.** Even if the kudos come months or years after the changes, the Bomb must always be sensitive to any action that might call peoples' memories back to his early missteps. Embrace humility if the changes turn out to be positive, pass all credit on to the team, and in particular point out one or two of the team that were substantively large contributors to the changes that came into being.

Ironically, if the Bomb can win back the team's trust, it can help forge a team's connections more solidly than had things gone well from the beginning, but the Bomb must be both sincere and engaging in their actions after the initial gaffe.
