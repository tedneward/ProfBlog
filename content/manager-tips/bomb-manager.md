description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is the manager whose task is to fix a team--and blow it up to do so.

"He's doing WHAT?" "Yup, you heard me, he scrapped all the code reviews, canceled the migration work, and has us all starting this new project that he thinks is 'super-pumped'." "But what did you say when he asked why we were doing the migration work?" "He never asked...." The Bomb manager, upon being given a team that has "a few problems", comes in and within a very short period of time (sometimes weeks, sometimes days) has an immediate plan of action which primarily consists of "blowing it all up" and either starting over, doing something entirely different, or putting the pieces back together themselves.

***Context:*** 

The Bomb manager, also sometimes called a Wrecking Ball manager, is warned (either officially or unofficially through the rumor mill) that their new team has low morale. So they come in looking for issues to fix. As is inevitable, right away, they find some. Wanting to look decisive and determined, they immediately institute changes to the team's processes and/or work schedule, disrupting the *status quo* and demanding adoption of the new decisions.

Sometimes this is because the Bomb has a reputation for determined and decisive leadership--it is not uncommon for a manager who has success leading a high-performance team to be given a new, lower-performing, team in the hopes that whatever "magic" they worked with the first team can be repeated with this one. They may even get to bring a member or two from their old team over to the new one, and it is a given that the new team does things differently than the old, both in terms of the processes (formal and informal) and culture within the team, as well as technology choices or work partitioning. The Bomb not only has a notion of what worked well (from the old team) but also finds that they have something of a reputation to protect--and the feeling of eyes on them as they take on the new team. Even if nothing of the sort is said out loud, there is a tacit pressure to "deliver results immediately".

The Wrecking Ball is warned that their new team has low morale. So they come in looking for issues to fix, and right away, they find a couple. Firstly, the majority of the team is working on a migration project that has hit repeated delays. Also, the team has a cumbersome approval process, making launches slow and frustrating. Wrecking Ball is determined and decisive. In their first week, they scrap the approval process. They also decide the migration isn’t worth the cost, cancel it, and reallocate the engineers to an exciting new project.

Unfortunately, in their haste to fix the problems, they don’t seek the team’s input. It turns out the migration would have resolved issues that have frustrated the team for years. Senior engineers on the team had instituted the approval process after multiple disastrous outages. Naturally, Wrecking Ball’s sweeping changes leave these senior engineers feeling slighted and unappreciated. Morale goes down instead of up; the most valuable talent is the first out the door.

Ironically, Wrecking Ball wasn’t wholly wrong. The migration had suffered from scope creep. The approval process was overly conservative. Their mistake was underestimating the emotional impact of their abrupt decisions and overestimating their own ability to diagnose and fix problems.

If they had collaborated with the team, the result could have been very different. Together they could have rescoped the migration to its original goals. A slimmed-down approval process would still prevent the most dangerous outages. The changes would have energized the team and leveraged the senior engineers instead of alienating them.
