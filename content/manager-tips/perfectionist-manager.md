description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is when a manager insists on only perfection.

"Wait, Gene's team *still* hasn't delivered? What the heck is going on over there?" "Well, Gene doesn't think the code is quite 100% thread-safe yet, so he's insisting the team write some more tests while he's working with Purchasing to get a static analysis tool to make sure there's no deadlocks anywhere. You know how he is." The Perfectionist wants their team’s work to be perfect. Unfortunately, the only way they know is to handle everything personally. They insist on reviewing every code change and design document. All project decisions go through them. When coupled with the Perfectionist’s boss' expectations of them to present updates to upper management and strategize with other teams, it comes as no surprise that the Perfectionist's team is perpetually "almost done".

***Context:*** 

The Perfectionist is often promoted entirely because of their "attention to detail" and fierce pride in the quality of their work. In fact, this is often explicitly cited in their promotion announcement, which has the effect of bringing that Perfectionism to a hyper-elevated degree of importance.

***Consequences:***

* **The Perfectionist becomes a bottleneck.** Because the Perfectionist cannot allow anything to leave the team without their fingerprints on it, all work must funnel through the Perfectionist, who quickly becomes swamped. The typical response of the Perfectionist is to put more hours in, making it even harder for any of the team to meet with them to get that necessary approval to move to the next stage. This leads to project delays and missed assignments.

* **Team morale (and composition) suffers.** The Perfectionist's inability to allow anything to go out without their fingerprints on it leads to deep distrust and frustration. Not only does the Perfectionist's need for involvement 

* **Team member promotion and career growth suffers.** By trying to be a hero, the Perfectionist denies the team its own chance to shine, and for individual members of the team to see their own stock grow within the company.

***Variants:*** 


***Mitigation:***

The root failure of the Perfectionist is that of trust, both in their team and in the organization around them. Because perfectionist tendencies are often rooted in [fear](./paranoia-of-wrong.md), they often feel they not only have sufficient cause, but corporate insistence, on everything being routed through them. Therefore, a two-pronged assault on the Perfectionist's assessment of the world is necessary:

* **Create trust of the team.** The Perfectionist needs to be wrestled out of the process, both figuratively and literally. In drastic situations, they may even have to be forced into taking PTO (and their network access taken away from them!) in order to let the team function without them. If the team they lead is even average, the team will have some successes to show for their time without the Perfectionist's input, which can serve as a first glimmer of realization that the team might not need the Perfectionist's input all the time.

* **Create trust in the organization.** The Perfectionist also needs to know that if the team does make a mistake, heads *won't* roll. This is up to the Perfectionist's manager to both reassure and demonstrate this before, during, and after any sort of incident. (Of course, if the company *does*, in fact, subscribe to the idea that someone needs to be fired in the event they make a wrong decision, then the Perfectionist was right all along, and the problem clearly lies far above your pay grade.)

* **Managerial training.** In some cases, the Perfectionist becomes this way because they are a [Smartest-Engineer Manager](smartest-engineer-manager.md) and, in the face of indecision, are doubling-down on what they know well (technical work) and finding comfort in that, which itself is rewarded when the quality of the work is praised. When stressed, they double-down again, until they are insisting all work come through them. By deliberately removing the Perfectionist from the technical work by sending them to some managerial training, two things can happen: one, the team is permitted to work (for a brief, glorious moment!) without the Perfectionist's influence, and two, the Perfectionist begins to gain some tools they can use to help address the managerial side of the job, rather than feeling lost and confused.

* **Enforce delegation.** The Perfectionist must begin to delegate tasks to others within their team. Technical work, such as code reviews and PR approvals, can often be given to the senior-most engineer or technologist on the team. Documentation reviews can be handed off to junior technical staff or even technical writers. Engineers can be given the freedom to make their own localized decisions. Even presentations to other teams can be handed off, freeing up the Perfectionist's time to focus on (a) meeting some of the strategic requests the boss asks for, (b) teaching moments when a decision turns out to be suboptimal, and (c) team member career growth, which will benefit from (and be encouraged by) the various tasks being delegated to them. As their manager, you must enforce the delegation of these tasks, and skip-level 1:1s with the Perfectionist's team members will help you keep the Perfectionist accountable to that delegation.
