description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is a manager who's somehow never around when managerial things need doing.

"Hey, we need to find out what happened with that purchase order for the license on our IDE. Did you Slack Bob? Did he follow up with Purchasing?" "Several times, actually. No response. Did you bring it up with him at your 1:1?" "What 1:1? He's canceled the last five." The Absentee manager is that manager that somehow never seems to be around, never seems to accomplish anything, and never seems to have any interest in their team.

***Context:*** 

The Absentee often doesn't hide from their team out of sheer incompetence, but more often than not because they are either (a) wildly overbooked with meetings and other work (often on behalf of their boss), (b) an interim manager filling in while candidates are interviewing for the open role, or (c) they lack skills (or even the confidence) to be the manager of the team. (The latter can often happen if someone is force-promoted into a management role against their wishes). 

***Consequences:*** 

The impact of an Absentee is often easy to predict:

* **Reduced progress.** The team often needs someone to remove obstacles to their progress, and the lack of a manager impedes those decisions from being made, which in turn keeps the team from being able to move forward with their assigned tasks.
* **Employee achievements are ignored.** Since the Absentee is never around or engaged with the team, any notable accomplishments or achievements realized by the team will never be discussed or promoted. In fact, it's often the case that the only time the team gets mentioned is when they miss a deadline or fail to meet expectations.
* **Lack of constructive feedback.** Because the Absentee isn't around to see the team and how they're working (or not working) well, they lack the ability to provide any sort of constructive suggestions to improve their work.
* **Team member exits.** If the manager remains Absentee for too long, the team members will conclude--quite rightly--that upper management isn't really all that concerned with their career development, and leave the team to find a team--and a company--that does.

***Mitigation:*** 

Often the only sign you will get that one of your direct reports is an Absentee is when the employee surveys come through and the team members report the lack of an active manager. Verifying this will be the first step, since often the Absentee is very good at making sure that they are "present" in any interaction with their manager (that is, you). However, one additional sign of an Absentee comes when the Absentee cannot provide particular details about the team's progress, activities or concerns.

Once identified, fixing an Absentee manager is often an exercise in getting them to "show up" for their team:

* **Hold them accountable to their necessary actions.** Make their execution of their managerial duties a formal part of their day-to-day activities. Review their team member performance notes in 1:1s. Ensure they have proper agendas for their team-wide and individual 1:1 meetings. And so on.

* **Verify they are following through on team-level 1:1s.** The most important meeting a manager can have is 1:1s with their team members, so the best way to make sure the Absentee is "showing up" is to ensure they are meeting with their team on a regular basis. You can do this through a couple of mechanisms, but make sure to connect with your HR team to make sure you're not crossing lines of privacy--usually you can't force yourself into their email to see if they're canceling meetings, for example.

* **Enforce skip-level 1:1s.** By meeting with the Absentee's team members on a regular cadence, you'll be able to triangulate the activities of the Absentee and make sure they're following through on being present. It will also help you make sure that team accomplishments and achievements can get recognized, even if the Absentee doesn't.
