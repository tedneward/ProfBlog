description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns. One of them is to put a buddy of the CEO or CTO in charge of the team.
~~~~~~

"Hi, team, my name is Charles, and I'm going to be taking over this team, as a favor to Biff. You know, your CTO? Excellent. So... what is you all do here?" It is not uncommon, particularly in smaller companies (especially startups) for a team to find themselves being led by a close acquaintance or (more often) "buddy" of someone in the CxO suite.

***Context:*** 

* **Decent.** The C-Buddy is often not a terrible person, nor are they deeply unqualified to run the team. Although there are certainly cases where the C-Buddy is, in fact, entirely incompetent, most of the time these folks are of similar skill level and stature as the CTO themselves, and while the litany of flaws in a CTO may be long, most incompetent CTOs don't last long.


***Consequences:*** 


***Variants:*** 


***Mitigation:*** 

**If you work for the Buddy.**

**If you are the Buddy.**

**If the Buddy works for you.**
