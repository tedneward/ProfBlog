For two decades, I've been involved in doing those things we now call "developer relations": those people within the company that connect to ("relate to") the developer community. I figured it was time to gather up some of the thoughts and ideas and suggestions into a single place.

One of the first things you should read is James Ward's ["Seven Artifacts of Developer Advocacy Projects"](https://jamesward.com/2021/09/26/the-seven-artifacts-of-developer-advocacy-projects/); in a nutshell, he writes:
> "Each developer advocacy project ideally produces seven artifacts:
> * Code Samples
> * A Blog Post
> * A Presentation and/or Video
> * A Hands-On Workshop
> * Broad Social Media Reach
> * Product Feedback
> * Enriched Community, Partner, or Customer Relationships

Personally, I think that's a good start on an ontology of DevRel activities, but I think it's not complete; I flesh out my own ontology [here](../blog/2022/dev-rel-ontology.html).
