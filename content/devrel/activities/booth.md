*Budget, Social*

***Also Known As***: Floor Presence.

***Problem***: You want to connect with developers within a certain community and have an opportunity to explain your product/service to them, ideally in the context of a conversation in which you can find out more about their issues, problems, concerns, budget, etc.

***Context***: The company wants to be present at an event that brings many people together under the umbrella of a particular identity (i.e., a tech-stack-centric conference) or region (i.e., a community event run for the immediate surrounding geographic area) or brand (i.e., a "destination" conference held in a popular city, like Las Vegas or Orlando), in order to connect with current and potential customers in a more interactive way.

***Solution***: You purchase booth space at a conference, and send a team to staff the booth during the conference's run.

***Consequences***: Participation in a conference event will often require somebody to be a point of contact for the conference; materials (such as the booth itself, printed handouts, any [Swag](swag.html), and so on) will need to be shipped to the event, schedules will need to be coordinated, and so on. This is a non-trivial commitment of time and energy, particularly so as the conference gets bigger (it's a much larger commitment of time to have a booth at AWS re:Invent than at a 250-person local community conference).

Manning the booth is also a non-trivial time commitment; ideally there should never be fewer than two people at the booth while the "vendor floor" is open (typically a 12-hour timeframe), so three or four people will be needed during each day of the conference. Additionally, some sort of [Swag](swag.html) to help draw initial interest to the booth is helpful, but do not be surprised when many developers stop by just for the swag.

Note that a company's booth presence does not prevent or assume the company is engaged in [Sponsorship](sponsorship.html) of the conference; where sponsorship flexes on Reach, the booth focuses on interactivity.

***Variants***:

* **Pit Crew.** If the company or the product/service doesn't directly fit the audience of the conference, but you still want a strong "presence" at the event, consider spending the Booth budget on sending a number of company employees to the event with the intent of "taking the field by storm": simply be out and around, milling on the floor, attending talks and absolutely being present at any [Conference Session](conference-session.html) being given by the DevRel team or other company employees. Pit Crew can carry [Swag](swag.html) around with them (if it's small) and hand it out as they move about the conference, or toss it out during the DevRel's talks ("Free T-shirt to anyone who asks a question!"). Be careful not to be too obnoxious about this, though, or the conference organizers (or the vendors that paid for a booth) may get annoyed and want to have a chat.

    Pit crew need not (and arguably shouldn't be) members of the DevRel team; sales, recruiters, marketing folks, and anyone who is looking to start speaking at events and/or considering a role as DevRel make for great Pit Crew, as it allows them to "feel the vibe" of a conference event. Associate Developer Advocates should always do a stint or two as Pit Crew before being sent on their own to a conference event.
