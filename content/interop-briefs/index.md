description=A list of links to pages about Java and .NET interoperability.
~~~~~~

I did a series of articles for a variety of folks, most notably TheServerSide, about interoperability between Java and .NET, the two dominant enterprise platforms at the time. (Arguably still are here in 2022, but who knows the date when you're reading this?) Those places have basically all but vanished by now, so I gathered the pieces back up and listed them out here.

* [Begin At The Beginning](./begin-at-the-beginning.html)
* [Check Your Politics](./check-your-politics.html)
* [In-Process Interoperability](./in-proc-interoperability.html)
* [In-Process Interoperability using IKVM](./in-proc-interop-with-ikvm.html)
* [Out-of-Process Interop Using JIntegra](./out-of-proc-interop-using-intrinsycs-j-integra.html)

Note that as of 2022 IKVM hasn't seen much update recently, it seems, and I think JIntegra may not even exist anymore... but some of the principles and concepts will still hold for more modern equivalents. (**NOTE**: Google reveals that as of 5 Mar 2022, [IKVM is alive and well](https://www.windwardstudios.com/blog/ikvm-is-alive-well), and [Yup, J-Integra still seems to be a thing](https://j-integra.intrinsyc.com/). Yay!)
