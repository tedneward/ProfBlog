A collection of my professional essays, re-homed for more permanent linkage, and to allow for a little less "date-threaded" conversation. Fully professional, still opinionated, but focused entirely on the industry in which I work (software development) and topics pertaining thereunto.

All opinions are mine.

Why is this called a "Wog"? Well, bluntly, Martin Fowler coined the phrase "Bliki", as a combination of the words "blog" and "wiki", and I kinda liked the idea, but wanted to take a different approach. So I combined "wiki" and "blog" and got... "wog". (You did ask.)
