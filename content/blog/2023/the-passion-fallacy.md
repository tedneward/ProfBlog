*tl;dr* Recently, while sitting in the speaker ready room at [VSLive Nashville](https://vslive.com/events/nashville-2023/home.aspx), I had a lovely conversation with [Angela Dugan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andugan/) and [Amber Vanderburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-vanderburg/) about something I've been saying for a few years now: **I don't want to hire passionate people, I want to hire professional people.** Turns out, Harvard Business Review agrees with me.

Passion is, by definition, illogical, and often leads people to act without thinking--we call them "crimes of passion" for a reason. Mostly, though, the distinction here is that the professional will do the parts of the job they dislike just as they will the parts they like--the professional knows it's a job, not a life choice or an identity.
