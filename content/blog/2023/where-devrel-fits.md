**tl;dr**: The Developer Relations org isn't exactly Engineering, but it's not entirely Marketing, and it often isn't really Sales. So if you're a company looking to find a home for your nascent (or currently-existing) DevRel team, where do you put it?

### Drawing conclusions

If the goal of the DevRel team isn't completely aligned with any of Engineering, Marketing, or Sales, then where in the organization does it go? The conclusion drawn here is actually not surprising, but it is a touch radical: ***Developer Relations deserves to be its own top-level organization within the company.*** Frankly, just as companies are realizing the benefits of having a "Chief Marketing Officer" and a "Chief Information Security Officer", a "Chief Developer Relations Officer" reporting directly to the CEO and providing the guidance and leadership to the CxO suite around the art and science of Developer Relations makes a great deal of sense Alternatively, if the "CDRO" title seems a touch pretentious, and the company lacks a CMO or CISO, then it's probably more appropriate to call it a "VP, Developer Relations", again reporting directly to the CEO as a peer to the VP of Marketing, VP of Sales, and VP of Engineering.

As we've seen above, the DevRel organization's goals are not the same as Engineering's goals, nor are they aligned perfectly with Marketing's or Sales'. This is not unusual--a long time ago, Marketing and Sales used to be unified into a single organization, until the realization became widespread that their goals were different. Each top-level organization should be (needs to be) able to pursue its goals independent of the others, and the leader at the top of that organization needs to be able to meet with peers to accomplish this.
