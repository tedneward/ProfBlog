**tl;dr**: Newcomers to Developer Relations are often curious as to what, exactly, makes up the range of activities that a Developer Advocate (and related individuals) undertake. In this post, I look to provide an ontology and means by which to examine what artifacts satisfy what needs, and how it isn't just about what artifacts a DevAd produces.

First of all, if you haven't seen James Ward's ["Seven Artifacts of Developer Advocacy Projects"](https://jamesward.com/2021/09/26/the-seven-artifacts-of-developer-advocacy-projects/), I highly recommend it before continuing onwards here.

Let me begin with [my working definition of Developer Relations](../../devrel/): 
> That part of the company that engages with developers, both internal and external to the company, for the purpose of using that relationship for net gain to both sides. This can take the form of many things, but ultimately, (a) it's aimed at developers, (b) it's intended to facilitate greater positivity to one or both sides, and (c) it centers around developer activities of one form or another (that is, it could be technical, "human skill", or process, but it kinda-sorta has to be around the world of software development).

> ***NOTE:*** Some folks will take issue with the part of my definition that starts it off: "This is that part of the company....", arguing that it's not limited to companies, i.e., open-source communities engage in Developer Relations. That may be true, but what we're seeing is that by the time the OSS community gets to the point of formalizing their relationship to the developers using their products/tools, they've usually formed some kind of foundation and it becomes somebody's job to take that relationship on.

Now let's examine James' list of seven artifacts, and use that as a stalking horse:

1. Code Samples
2. A Blog Post
3. A Presentation and/or Video
4. A Hands-On Workshop
5. Broad Social Media Reach
6. Product Feedback
7. Enriched Community, Partner, or Customer Relationships

Each of these provides some value along three different axes:

* ***Reach***: How "far" does this artifact go? How many people can see it and/or consume it? Those things done over the Internet tend to have a large reach (particularly if the artifact is someplace where Google can find it and pop it up during search results), whereas those things done in person (such as the hands-on workshop) will have very short reach, since participation requires physical presence.
* ***Interactivity***: This is the fidelity of communication--how "conversational" is the artifact? This in many cases is in inverse proportion to reach, but not always. The blog post doesn't really allow for great conversation (yes, you can open up comments on the blog, but we all know what happens when you do, and it's not pretty), whereas a workshop really requires a high degree of interactivity with the attendees. The blog post author doesn't learn much from their audience when posting the blog--the workshop facilitator, however, can learn all kinds of things from the attendees via the questions they ask, the problems they run into, the questions they don't ask, and so on.
* ***Direction***: One thing James hints at, but doesn't really call out strongly, is the idea that DevRel is a circular exercise: DevRel should be talking to both those developers inside the company as well as those outside of it. This means the usual activities of bringing development discussions to developers that might be customers of the company's product, but also bringing feedback from those developers on the outside back into the company for further discussion and/or examination.
