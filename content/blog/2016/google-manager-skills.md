I'll admit, my first reaction was, "Hey, some of those 8 things aren't really skills,
*per se*, as much as they are the effects you want to see come out of your manager".
For example, "Empowers team and does not micromanage" isn't really a skill, as it were, but
more of an abstract guiding principle that would encompass things like, "Gives an employee
a goal and a deadline, then steps out of the way to see them accomplish it, unless asked
to step in and assist". The one is abstract, and the other, much more concrete, and---more
importantly, if you ask me---more actionable on the part of somebody who wants to become
a better manager.

But, buried deep within the article towards the end are the real precious jewels of
the whole thing---Google's links to [re:Work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/managers/)'s
guides on management, which (so far) I find to be a useful set of reading materials. Not as
good as some of the books I've been reading, but a good place to start for anybody who's
trying to get started as a manager.
