description=What is an R-and-D research team?
~~~~~~
There are four different kinds of R&D teams, each with very different actions and goals, and each with very different outcomes. The success of the team often depends on aligning the activities of the team with the intended goals, and it's actually quite reasonable for a company to have two or more teams, each operating independently and towards different ends. In this post, I explore the Research Team.

As a reminder, there are four kinds of R&D Teams:

* the ***[Scout team](./scout-team.md)***, exploring what tech others in the industry have built (e.g., Flutter, SwiftUI, etc)
* the ***[Spy team](./spy-team.md)***, exploring what competitors have built
* the ***[Library team](./library-team.md)***, building lowest-common-denominator libraries used (sometimes) within the company
* the ***[Practical Research team](./research-team.md)***, building novel solutions to the company's (and others') problems

### The (Practical) Research Team
The Research team is the one most people think about with respect to an R&D team, but it's important to note that the team cannot be just focused on research--like the Scout team, the Research team has to have a constant eye on what they build having a practical impact on the company that sponsors them. For that reason, I often make the conscious decision to put the word "practical" in front of the name, so that the emphasis is on practical research that will have a direct effect on the company's ability to execute.

**The Problem:** It has been proven, over and over again, that companies that don't spend time thinking about how to leverage technology to make their business run more effectively or more interconnectedly or more... well, pick your favorite adverb here, it probably applies... will find that they are being surpassed by competitors who have. This statement, however, is exceedingly vague, and is often vague on purpose--nobody exactly knows what the "next big thing" will be, so they don't know ahead of time what the right adverb is to use!

For example, there was a time when simply shipping something on the company's website was sufficient. Then it needed to be up there more quickly than the competitors. Then it needed to be faster and more interactive. Then the push was to get more users on the platform. And so on and so on. With each "internet generation" a new adverb became the watchword of the industry, and massive amounts of time and energy were spent chasing that adverb. (Case in point: For a while, the chief goal was "scale"/"scalability", and many companies went bankrupt trying to build a platform that could handle the "inevitable" challenges of having a million simultaneous users on the platform--even before they had their first user.)

If a Research team is trying to build things that will help the company go to "where the puck will be, instead of where it is now", as the famous hockey player is famous for saying, then the Research team is one that is firmly in the position of having to make fantastic guesses on a regular basis, and--worse--be right all the time or risk being accused of wasting time and money. (Picture this exchange, if you will: "What do you mean you went out and built tools for integrating with a blockchain?" "But boss, back in 2020, you said..." "Blockchain is dead! (I read it in Forbes!) You should be chasing after AI!" Now imagine what the exchange was like in 2016, 2012, 2008, ....)

The humbling truth for most businesses is that whatever the current industry hype is, it's probably not the thing that will most "move the needle" for the company. And, worse, you can almost be certain that your competitor's CEO is currently yelling at their staff about the exact same thing--in 2024, everybody is chasing AI, such that the memes ("Hey, we have a pitch meeting in five minutes; do me a favor, take our pitch deck and replace all the uses of 'blockchain' with 'AI', would you?") are omnipresent on the social media feeds. And yet, even as we know that everybody is chasing it, the biological imperative inside of our lizard brains keeps whispering, "Yeah, but what if they're RIGHT this time? We could be hopelessly behind!" (all the while trying desperately to make you forget that it whispered the same thing about blockchain five years ago).

In many respects, the problem with a Practical Research R&D team isn't the "research" part of it--it's the "practical" part of it.

**Successful Execution:**
