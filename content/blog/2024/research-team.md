description=What is an R-and-D research team?
~~~~~~
There are four different kinds of R&D teams, each with very different actions and goals, and each with very different outcomes. The success of the team often depends on aligning the activities of the team with the intended goals, and it's actually quite reasonable for a company to have two or more teams, each operating independently and towards different ends. In this post, I explore the Research Team.

As a reminder, there are four kinds of R&D Teams:

* the ***Scout team***, exploring what tech others in the industry have built (e.g., Flutter, SwiftUI, etc)
* the ***Spy team***, exploring what competitors have built
* the ***Library team***, building lowest-common-denominator libraries used (sometimes) within the company
* the ***Practical Research team***, building novel solutions to the company's (and others') problems
