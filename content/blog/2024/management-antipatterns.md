description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns.
~~~~~~

Ever had a manager who was clearly smart, but had no idea how to manage? Or one of those managers who was "laterally promoted" over from a team that was radically different from what your team did? There's a whole host of mistakes that companies often fall prey to with respect to those they have leading teams, and I thought it a good idea to collect them into one place, under the umbrella heading of "manager antipatterns". (Because "antipatterns" sounds better than "often-repeated mistakes that we really should have learned from so that we don't make them again, and yet...".)

Within each of these, I try to provide a barebones pattern form, but most importantly, advice on how to rectify the situation, split into three different forks: when you work for that manager, when you have that manager reporting to you, and when you are that manager.

A sample:

* ["The Absentee Manager"](../../manager-tips/absentee-manager.html): "What manager?"
* ["The Bomb Manager"](../../manager-tips/bomb-manager.html): "We need to toss it all and start over."
* ["The Funnel Manager"](../../manager-tips/funnel-manager.html): "Wait until you hear what my boss told me today!"
* ["The Hammer Manager"](../../manager-tips/hammer-manager.html): "I only know how to use a hammer, so I'm going to hammer away with it"
* ["The Headless Chicken Manager"](../../manager-tips/hlc-manager.html): "OMG OMG OMG I don't know what to do OMG OMG OMG"
* ["The Laissez-Faire Manager"](../../manager-tips/laissez-faire-manager.html): "I'm going to be the opposite of a micromanager, and leave them totally alone"
* ["The Lateral-Move Manager"](../../manager-tips/lateral-move-manager.html): "Let's take a manager from one group and move them to run a team in a totally different area of the company"
* ["The Perfectionist Manager"](../../manager-tips/perfectionist-manager.html): "Hey, it's MY team, so the work isn't done until I think it's perfect."
* ["The Smartest-Engineer Manager"](../../manager-tips/smartest-engineer-manager.html): "Let's promote the smartest engineer on the team to manager"
* ["The Sphinx Manager"](../../manager-tips/sphinx-manager.html): "Riddle me this...."
* ["The Tech-Lead Manager"](../../manager-tips/tech-lead-manager.html): "Let's just have a developer be a manager and a developer at the same time"
