description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns.
~~~~~~

Ever had a manager who was clearly smart, but had no idea how to manage? Or one of those managers who was "laterally promoted" over from a team that was radically different from what your team did? There's a whole host of mistakes that companies often fall prey to, and I thought it a good idea to collect them into one place, under the umbrella heading of "antipatterns". (Because "antipatterns" sounds better than "often-repeated mistakes that we really should have learned from so that we don't make them again, and yet...".)

Within each of these, I try to provide a barebones pattern form, but most importantly, advice on how to rectify the situation, split into three different forks: when you work for that manager, when you have that manager reporting to you, and when you are that manager.

Note that, in order to post these more often than not, I'll be writing these up as separate posts and putting links to them in this post.

* ["The Absentee Manager"](../../manager-tips/absentee-manager.html): "What manager?"
* ["The Bomb Manager"](../../manager-tips/bomb-manager.html): "We need to toss it all and start over."
* ["The C-Buddy Manager"](../../manager-tips/c-buddy-manager.html): "Let's put a buddy of the CxO's in charge of the team"
* ["The Documentation-Abuse Manager"](../../manager-tips/doc-abuse-manager.html): "If it isn't in the spec, written down, or otherwise documented, it didn't or doesn't happen."
* ["The Flagpole Manager"](../../manager-tips/flagpole-manager.html): "I don't want to make any sort of decision, ever, so I'm going to pass this up the flagpole"
* ["The Funnel Manager"](../../manager-tips/funnel-manager.html): "Wait until you hear what my boss told me today!"
* ["The Hammer Manager"](../../manager-tips/hammer-manager.html): "I only know how to use a hammer, so I'm going to hammer away with it"
* ["The Headless Chicken Manager"](../../manager-tips/hlc-manager.html): "OMG OMG OMG I don't know what to do OMG OMG OMG"
* ["The Laissez-Faire Manager"](../../manager-tips/laissez-faire-manager.html): "I'm going to be the opposite of a micromanager, and leave them totally alone"
* ["The Lateral-Move Manager"](../../manager-tips/lateral-move-manager.html): "Let's take a manager from one group and move them to run a team in a totally different area of the company"
* ["The Metric-Abuse Manager"](../../manager-tips/metric-abuse-manager.html): "Well, we are a data-driven company, so I'm going to overindex on the data part of that."
* ["The Perfectionist Manager"](../../manager-tips/perfectionist-manager.html): "Hey, it's MY team, so the work isn't done until I think it's perfect."
* ["The Project-Manager Manager"](../../manager-tips/pm-manager.html): "Let's put the project manager in charge so they can crack the whip as necessary"
* ["The Smartest-Engineer Manager"](../../manager-tips/smartest-engineer-manager.html): "Let's promote the smartest engineer on the team to manager"

* ["The Tech-Lead Manager"](../../manager-tips/tech-lead-manager.html): "Let's just have a developer be a manager and a developer at the same time"
Not only are there manager-based antipatterns, though, there's also some collective management-culture antipatterns that I think are useful to call out:

* ["Unanimous Consensus Decision-Making"](../../manager-tips/consensus.html): All decisions must be made by a group, which must be unanimous in their decision.
* ["The Paranoia of Wrong"](../../manager-tips/paranoia-of-wrong.html): "Just remember, if you get it wrong, you could be fired."
