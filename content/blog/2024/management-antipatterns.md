description=Many companies make the same sorts of mistakes with their managers, over and over again. If they were software designs, we'd call them antipatterns.

Ever had a manager who was clearly smart, but had no idea how to manage? Or one of those managers who was "laterally promoted" over from a team that was radically different from what your team did? There's a whole host of mistakes that companies often fall prey to, and I thought it a good idea to collect them into one place, under the umbrella heading of "antipatterns". (Because "antipatterns" sounds better than "often-repeated mistakes that we really should have learned from so that we don't make them again, and yet...".)

Within each of these, I try to provide a barebones pattern form, but most importantly, advice on how to rectify the situation, split into three different forks: when you work for that manager, when you have that manager reporting to you, and when you are that manager.

Note that, in order to post these more often than not, I'll be writing these up as separate posts and putting links to them in this post.
