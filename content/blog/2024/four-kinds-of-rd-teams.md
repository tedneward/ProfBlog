~~~~~~
Many developers get really excited when they join an R&D team, because it signals in their minds that they're among an elite group looking to move the needle for a company. We imagine the business suddenly soaring in revenue and profit because of the whatever-thing we just built. We can hear--in the mind's ear--the kudos and praise raining down from the C-Suite as the whatever-thing we just built is rolled out company-wide and maybe, just maybe, industry-wide. We're excited!

Wait, what was it we were trying to do again?

In my [last post](../2024/the-problem-with-rd-teams.md), I talked about some of the problems with R&D teams and how they're run. What I didn't really get into in that post, however, was the idea that (I believe) there are four different kinds of R&D teams, each with very different actions and goals, and each with very different outcomes. The success of the team often depends on aligning the activities of the team with the intended goals, and it's actually quite reasonable for a company to have two or more teams, each operating independently and towards different ends.

In brief, there are four kinds of R&D Teams:

* the ***Scout team***, exploring what tech others in the industry have built (e.g., Flutter, SwiftUI, etc)
* the ***Spy team***, exploring what competitors have built
* the ***Library team***, building lowest-common-denominator libraries used (sometimes) within the company
* the ***Practical Research team***, building novel solutions to the company's (and others') problems

Let's address each of these in some level of detail.

### The Scout Team


### The Library Team


### The Spy Team


### The Practical Research Team
