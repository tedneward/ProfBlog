<p>
It's that time of year again....
</p>
        <p>
First, as always, we revisit the predictions <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2014/01/03/Tech+Predictions+2014.aspx">I
made last year</a>, and see how well they stacked up. (Because, as I've said before,
anybody can make predictions without going back to measure your accuracy; I believe
in accountability, even to my own silly blog predictions.)
</p>
        <p>
On 3 January, 2014, I said: 
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>iOS, Android and Windows8 start to move into your car.</b> Ehhhh.... Yeah, sort
of, but not nearly as much as I thought they would. There's a few folks experimenting
with this, but frankly, after a big splash announcement, the idea pretty much went
nowhere. I don't think the idea is "done", per se, but I do think we're looking at
a three-to-five year quiescience while the industry figures out what to do with this
(and do it in such a way that it doesn't kill somebody). (And no, by the way, I don't
count Google's self-driving car as a point for me under this item--that's a wholly
different thing.)</li>
          <li>
            <b>Wearable tech hypes up (with little to no actual adoption or innovation).</b> I
said, "There'll be absolutely zero reason for anyone to get one for calendar year
2014", and frankly, I stand by that. The Samsung smart watch, the Google Glass, all
of the third-party wearables... none of them have really "wow"ed anybody with their <i>raison
d'etre</i>. Sure, get text messages on your watch, or place a call (on your phone)
from the watch.... But nobody's doing that. I see hardly any of the wearables out
in the wild, with the sole exception of those who are wearing a FitBit or something
similar. (The Microsoft Band looked like a cool device, but again... nobody's using
them in the wild for anything but exercise stat tracking. That's hardly a "gotta have
it" kind of reason.)</li>
          <li>
            <b>Apple's gadgets will be more of the same.</b> Basically, I said, "iPhone, iPad,
iPod, MacBook, they're all going to be incremental refinements on what we see already."
And sure enough, the iPhone got a little bigger, there was no real MacBookPro refresh,
and the iWatch is still pretty much vapor at this point (and it's not clear what compelling
reason it would have even if it did ship). Sure, the image is there on the Apple website,
slated for "early 2015", but frankly... it's a watch. One that I'll have to recharge
every night or two. Yawn. Not impressed, so far. I said, "Apple is clearly the market
leader, and they are clearly in the grips of the Innovator's Dilemma, and they have
no clear challenger (yet) that threatens to dethrone them, leaving them with no reason
to shake up the status quo", and I stand behind that 100%.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Android market consolidates further around Samsung and Motorola.</b> I'm sorry,
Moto-who? They've all but disappeared from the Android marketplace in a lot of ways,
leaving it to be a two-horse race: Samsung/Android vs Apple/iOS. In fact, I think
Google is spinning Motorola back off again into its own entity, and the industry collectively...
Meh'ed. Given how much angst there was when Google acquired Motorola, I would've thought
this would've had a bigger impact, but I think Google figured out fairly quickly that
they're not really a hardware company, and don't want to be.</li>
          <li>
            <b>We'll see one iOS release, two minor Android releases, and maybe two Windows8 minor
releases.</b> "I can't see the mobile market getting any kind of major surprise this
year." Yep. One iOS release (8), two minor Android releases... well, Android 5 isn't
a minor release, but until it ships on hardware, it's hard to call it a "major" release,
either. I'd almost call it vaporware, except it's the opposite--it's there, anybody
can build for it, you just can't... <i>run</i>... it anywhere.
</li>
          <li>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Windows 8/8.1/9/whatever gains a little respect, but not market share gains.</b> Surface
3 is an awesome device--not because it runs Windows8/9/whatever, but in spite of it,
for a lot of people. But beyond the Surface, are any tablets/mobiles running Win8/9/whatever
getting much traction? I don't see it. Sadly, Windows remains a laptop-bound OS, though
the traditional definition of "laptop" is clearly getting a makeover as PC manufacturers
try to muscle in on the iPad space from the other direction.</li>
          <li>
            <b>UI/UX emphasis is going to start moving to "alternate" input streams.</b> Yeah,
would've been nice, but it's not there yet. Kinect has kind of faded into a whimper. <i>Minority
Report</i>-style interfaces are still the stuff of science fiction for the time being,
and probably will be, again, for the rest of the decade.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Java-the-language starts to see a resurgence of "mojo".</b> Oh, my, yes. Devoxx
this year was quite all abuzz about Java8, and it really feels (to many in the Java
community) that Java's got its "buzz" back, at least at the language level. JavaEE
is basically shot/fragmented to all hell, but JavaSe is definitely turning a few peoples'
eyes in the Java space. Language creators for the JVM that just want to create "a
better Java" by taking basic C/C++-style syntax and adding anonymous functions are
basically consigning themselves to "this is a fun side research project that I expect
to go nowhere" status.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Meanwhile, this will be a quiet year for C#.</b> Yeah... kind of. It's hard to
call this one; on the one hand, nothing officially shipped, but on the other hand,
Roslyn and its ilk got open-sourced, which is kind of a big deal... if you like dabbling
with langauges and/or using language tools directly as part of your toolchain... which
really is just a small percentage of developers. I dunno--hard to say.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Functional languages will remain "hipster" tools that most people can't use.</b> Yeah...
*sigh*. I wish this weren't the case, but 2014 was not the "year of the FP'er", by
any stretch. Scala is making strides and getting some folks really excited... but
those folks were the ones already excited. I don't see it making its way "down" the
"programmer hipster ladder", so to speak, to reach "regular" line-of-business developers,
and tools like sbt are <i>not</i> helping. (sbt's syntax is really something only
its mother could love... and she'd only admit it if it were in the hospital or something.)
I get that it's cool that you can use operators like ~&gt;&gt;= in your language, guys,
but in a build tool? Seriously? That is not lowering the barrier to entry.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Dynamic languages will see continued growth and success.</b> Well, Node got forked.
Dunno what that means. Ruby seemed to actually lose a little steam, and <a href="http://rubini.us/2014/12/31/matz-s-ruby-developers-don-t-use-rubyspec/">some
cynicism and frustration seems to be setting in</a>, particularly among the different
"breeds" of Ruby developers. Python still just sort of... hangs out there... with
a dedicated community that seems to be getting no larger and no smaller. And Apple's
Swift... well, it's not really a dynamic language, per se, but it's not exactly a
statically-typed one, either... Oh, hell, I give up. You tell me whether this is continued
growth or success. On the other hand, I did say, "I'm becoming more and more convinced
that having a language that supports both static and dynamic typing capabilities represents
the best compromise between those two poles of software development languages", and
boy does that seem to be happening, with Swift just being the largest-splash of the
examples so far.</li>
          <li>
            <b>HTML 5 "fragmentation" will start to echo in the industry.</b> Not happening, unless
you call the different browsers' different levels of support for HTML 5 "fragmentation".
Wait--that's exactly what that looks like. So... is it any worse than before? Folks,
any time a website tells you "This site best viewed in..." or "This page optimized
for...", that's exactly what that looks like. And it's happening now: Chrome is the
most egregious of the lot, with most developers choosing to optimize for it, but the
fact that anybody's doing it for any browser tells you that the "standard" really
isn't.</li>
          <li>
            <b>"Mobile browsers" become just "browsers".</b> Open your phone browser. Browse to
a page. Aside from the smaller screen, is there anything the browser doesn't support
that your desktop does? Didn't think so. As a matter of fact, Android finally just
up and admitted it, and now ships with Chrome as an app on their Samsung/Android devices.
Let the "mobile browser" be done, and it's eulogy written here: "Farewell, mobile
browser, and take your crappy disadvantages with you; we missed you not at all."</li>
          <li>
            <b>"Mobile web" starts a slow, steady slide into irrelevancy. ... sites optimized
for "mobile" browsing experiences--which represents a non-trivial development effort
in most cases--will start to drop away, mostly due to neglect.</b> Yep.</li>
          <li>
            <b>"Responsive web" becomes the new black. ... we'll see web sites using CSS frameworks
(among other tools) to build user interfaces that adjust themselves to the physical
viewsizes and input capabilities of the target browser.</b> Yep. This is becoming
a necessary skill for web designers, and any new Web-facing application that ships
without some level of responsiveness may as well just write at least half of its potential
market off.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Microsoft fails to name a Ballmer successor.</b> Helloooooo, Satya Nadella. I'm
not a Microsoft Insider, I had no idea who this guy was when he got announced. But
so far, I'm pleased with what he's done. Granted, <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/microsoft-ceo-fire-saying-women-trust-hr-systems-deliver-raises/">he
hasn't been perfect</a>, but he's doing the right things from a company perspective--embracing
other languages and platforms, and providing clear direction for the company as a
whole... for the most part. Jury's still out, and will be for at least the next half-decade,
but he came out clearly wanting to make his mark, and he did. Now let's see how far
Microsoft employees will follow him and his guidance, and then let's see how the market
does. The first is a lot easier than the second, but the second doesn't happen without
the first.</li>
          <li>
            <b>"Programmable Web" becomes an even bigger thing, leading companies to develop APIs
that make no sense to anybody.</b> Have you seen <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>?
It's like the DOS batch file language of the Internet. And if that's too much, try <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>.
It's the... I dunno, what's higher-level than DOS batch files? Seriously, Web APIs
are becoming so expected that any day now I expect to see a Web API that allows you
to create a Web API on demand. (And we're actually <a href="http://raml.org/projects.html">closer
than you think...</a>)</li>
          <li>
            <b>Five new single-page JavaScript MVC application frameworks will ship and gather
interest.</b> You count--I'm getting tired. AngularJS 2.0 is going to take a different
direction from 1.x, which almost makes it a new framework. Famo.us is getting close
to ship. Ionic. And that's just off the top of my head. The JavaScript ecosystem is
rapidly spinning into that open-source freefall that the Java-Web world turned into,
and didn't climb out of for more than a half-decade.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Apple's MacPro machine inspires dozens of knock-off clones.</b> Nope. Not a peep.
Oh, well.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Desktop machine sales creep slightly higher.</b> I don't have the numbers handy,
and it's 1AM as I write this, so I'm not looking. Even if it's not happening in 2014,
I think over the next half-dozen years we're going to see that 80/20 mobile/desktop
split, in time.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Dozens of new "cloud" platforms will be introduced, and most of them will remain
entirely irrelevant behind the "Big Three".</b> Well, dozens are coming out, depending
on which flavor of "*aaS" you consider to be "Cloud", and what seems to be happening
is that the Big Three are picking them up and incorporating them as part of their
offering (a la what happened with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/index.html">FireBase</a>).
This is probably only going to rise--Heroku got picked up by SalesForce somewhere
along the way, for example, and I fully expect Parse to do the same before long. As
for the big players (Oracle, HP, etc) that aren't one of the Big Three... yeah, they'll
quietly fade and die.</li>
          <li>
            <b>We will never see any kind of official announcement, much less actual working prototypes,
around Amazon's "Drone Delivery" program ever again.</b> Anybody? Anybody? Lots of
discussion around drones, but nothing from Amazon, and certainly nothing shipped.</li>
        </ul>
Overall.... *shrug* About par for the course, 50/50 by my count.
<p>
So what do I see for 2015? Here goes: 
</p><ul><li><b>"Big data", "Big data", "Big data". You will get sick of this phrase.</b> What
I didn't say last year was anything about big data, and frankly, the hype machine
is not even remotely close to being done with this. EVERYTHING will be made into a
"big data" play before 2015 is over, to the point where nobody knows what "big data"
really means anymore... except for the people quietly doing it.</li><li><b>"Internet of Things". You will get sick of this phrase, too.</b> Look, let's just
call it right now: IoT is clearly in the overestimate-in-5-years/underestimate-in-10-years
Bill Gates quote territory. We have no idea what IoT will end up looking like, practically
speaking, and yet billions will be spent on people who claim to know exactly that.
Save your money. Or, if you really want to give a smart-sounding consulting some cash
to tell you what you already know, send it my way, and I'll show up at your place
of business, look wise and distinguished, and tell your boss, "It depends" in fifty
pages and with two-hundred PowerPoint slides. Everybody wins.</li><li><b>"Internet of Medicine" or "Big Med".</b> I'm calling this one right here: with
all the health-related big data plays going on right now, it's only a matter of time
before some chirpy journalist or press agent coins this. It's a fascinating opportunity--there's
a lot of really interesting and cool ideas around the intersection of big data-about-your-health,
the wearables world, medical AI/data-analysis, and mobile devices, and just about
every entrepreneur and VC is going after it. So within the next year or two, many
of those are going to ship in some form, and then... I have no idea, but it'll be
big/catastrophic, whatever happens.</li><li><b>"Tech bubble" becomes a "thing".</b> Internet- and technology-related firms are
getting ridiculous valuations, and those of us who were in the industry in the years
leading up to 2000 know what this means. I'm sorry, but when <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pluralsight-is-worth-almost-a-billion-dollars-2014-8">a
technology-training company gets valued at <i>$1 billion</i></a>, which is more than
some Fortune-5000 firms that've been around for a half-century or more.... this is
clearly "bubble" territory. Trust me, I don't want this bubble to pop, particularly
since I'm supposed to be releasing a few courses through them, but I remember when
everybody was certain that "Pets.com" was a multi-million Web property, too... and
I remember when I worked for a company that thought technology training was a "recession-proof"
industry. These numbers are ridiculous, and it's only going to take one high-value
collapse to start pulling the rest of the house of cards down. Before 2020, you mark
my words. In 2015, though, the warnings and arguments against those warnings are only
going to intensify.</li><li><b>C# and Java will both make big announcements.</b> C# 6 will probably ship somewhere
in 2015 (they called the product "Visual Studio 2015", after all), and Java9 will
probably start to make some news towards the end of 2015, though I don't expect it
to ship. Those who care will take note, those who don't, won't. Really, we're kind
of past the point where either of those languages are going to be interesting to anyone
who's not already in that space.</li><li><b>Go is going to either take off, or crash and burn.</b> Go seems to be approaching
an inflection point, and while I'm not smart enough to know what's going to happen
there, I think this will be a year of decision for them.</li><li><b>Microsoft acquires Xamarin.</b> Microsoft seems to be coyly flirting with the idea,
and really, it makes a ton of sense for them to do so: it gives them a way to be relevant
on the two major mobile platforms without abandoning .NET or their own platform. Really,
the only question that remains is what kind of cash it would take to do the buyout,
and does Microsoft have that money available to it after its rather (IMHO) ill-advised
acquisitions of the past (*cough* Nokia *cough*).</li><li><b>Amazon just quietly keeps churning.</b> Really, this seemed like a pretty quiet
year for Microsoft's cross-Sound neighbor, and I don't know that'll change in 2015.
Kindle seems pretty successful, but the Fire doesn't seem like it's gone far as a
full-fledged mobile device. Amazon is fighting some brush fires on its borders over
licensing and royalties, and that's probably distracting them in some major ways.
(They're also developing a reputation as a firm that burns employees out fast, which
also isn't helping, I imagine.) I don't think 2015 is a year of huge developments
for them, but in a lot of ways, they don't need them--AWS is, as near as I can tell,
the gold standard of "cloud", and as long as they just keep pace with whatever Azure
comes out with, they're in good shape there.</li><li><b>Google continues to throw sh*t against the wall, looking for their Next Big Thing.</b> What
I mean by that is this: Among wine snobs, there is a story (possibly apocryphal) of
a wine-tasting expert who had a wall in his house painted a very particular shade
of white. Then, when tasting a red wine, he would throw the contents of the glass
against that wall, to observe the color and the way the wine beaded and ran down the
wall as part of his evaluation. Frankly, that kind of feels like what Google is doing:
throwing idea after idea "against the wall" of public opinion, trying to see what
stands out and looks great and garners interest. If I didn't know better, I'd say
they're desperately trying to find a new line of revenue beyond AdWords, just as Microsoft
a decade ago was desperately trying to find a new line of revenue beyond Windows.
Expect a lot of announcements, a lot of "beta"s, and none of it with any kind of realistic
or even well-planned business model behind it--including the Google Car.</li><li><b>Web use on mobile devices decreases in favor of apps.</b> This is going to happen
whether the public wants it or not, because companies have figured out that it behooves
them to have you "trapped" inside their app (where they can control all the content)
rather than on their website. More and more websites are going to try and redirect
you to inside their app, rather than allow you to casually browse on their site, because
then they think they "own" your eyeballs. The only way this changes is if/when some
firm gets crushed in the court of public opinion by doing something really stupid...
and that won't happen in 2015. Wait for it in 2016.</li><li><b>Hipster "Uber for X" apps will be all the rage.</b> Every technology event is going
to be filled with 20- and 30-somethings who are convinced that the world wants/needs
an app that will allow customers to get X (service or good) delivered right to wherever-they're-standing,
without doing one iota of business research as to whether that model makes any sense
anywhere outside of New York or San Francisco. They will get millions in VC, confidently
proclaim themselves the next Facebook, and then implode. (This might actually be what
starts the tech bubble implosion.)</li><li><b>Mark Zuckerberg grows up a little.</b> Remember his "You're washed up when you're
30" crack? He turns 30, and I suspect he doesn't think he's "done" quite yet. As he
tries to become more of a "technology statesman" (which is really the next step for
him), however, he's going to get caught up on that remark over and over again from
people who just want to see him fail or be embarrassed, until he either admits, "Yeah,
OK, I was wrong" or gets so frustrated he buys a small island in the South Pacific,
screams "I hate you all!" and flees the country. (Hopefully he remembers to update
his status before he goes.)</li><li><b>Larry Ellison buys a sports team.</b> Yeah, he's got a yacht, but now Ballmer owns
the Clippers. Paul Allen has the World Champion Seattle Seahawks. If either of the
Google boys puts in for the Buffalo Bills or St Louis Rams, this is a given.... and
I think he buys the Golden State Warriors.</li><li><b>Perl makes one final gasp at relevancy, fails, and begins to decompose.</b> C'mon,
when's the last time the Perl community made a "This time we mean it! Perl 6 is going
to ship!" announcement? They're like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana">Daikatana</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever">Duke
Nukem Forever</a> of programming languages by this point. If you're still using Perl,
just accept fate, switch to Python, Ruby, or even Node. Nobody can take your memories
from you.</li></ul>
... annnnnnnd I'm spent.
<p>
Happy New Year, everyone. May your 2015 be everything you want it to be, and a few
more things beyond that. Be kind to yourself, generous to others, humble in the spotlight
and lavish in your praise of those around you. Cheers!
</p>
