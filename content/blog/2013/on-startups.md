<p>Curious to know what Ted's been up to? Head on over to <a href="http://signup.livethelook.com">here</a> and sign up.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm a CTO of a bootstrap startup. (Emphasis on the "bootstrap" part of that--always looking for angel investors!) And no, we're not really in "stealth mode", I'll be happy to tell you what we're doing if you drop me an email directly; we're just trying to "manage the message", in startup lingo.</p>

<p>We're only going to be under wraps for a few more weeks before the real site is live. And then.... *crossing fingers*</p>

<p>Don't be too surprised if the tone of some of my blog posts shifts away from low-level tech stuff and starts to include some higher-level stuff, by the way. I'm not walking away from the tech, by any stretch, but becoming a CTO definitely has opened my eyes, so to speak, that the entrepreneur CTO has some very different problems to think about than the enterprise architect does.</p>
