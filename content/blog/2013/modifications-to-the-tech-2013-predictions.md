<p>I just added this to my Tech 2013 Predictions; I think they're important enough to re-post here as new content too:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware is the new platform.</strong> A buddy of mine (Scott Davis) pointed out on a mailing list we share that "hardware is the new platform", and with Microsoft's Surface out now, there's three major players (Apple, Google, Microsoft) in this game. It's becoming apparent that more and more companies are starting to see opportunities in going the Apple route of owning not just the OS and the store, but the hardware underneath it. More and more companies are going to start playing this game, too, I think, and we're going to see Amazon take some shots here, and probably a few others. Of course, already announced is the Ubuntu Phone, and a new Android-like player, <a href="http://www.tizen.org">Tizen</a>, but I'm not thinking about new players--there's always new players--but about some of the big standouts. And look for companies like Dell and HP to start looking for ways to play in this game, too, either through partnerships or acquisitions. (Hello, Oracle, I'm looking at you.... And Adobe, too.)</li>
<li><strong>APIs for lots of things are going to come out.</strong> Ford <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/07/ford-launches-open-developer-program-to-let-mobile-apps-interface-with-its-cars/">just</a> did <a href="http://developer.ford.com">this</a>. This is not going away--this is going to proliferate. And the startup community is going to lap it up like kittens attacking a bowl of cream. If you're looking for a play in the startup world, pursue this.</li>
</ul>
