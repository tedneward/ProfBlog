<p>Remember when I posted about speaking for free at conferences? And everybody got so upset? Because, you know... community!</p>

<p>Somebody tell me how <a href="http://imgur.com/r/MusicNews/sOsHnbf">this</a> is any different.</p>

<p>When a conference chooses not to offer its speakers even a modest stipend beyond expenses (and let's not even begin to discuss the conferences who don't bother covering expenses), they are essentially asking the speaker to do all that work for free. Just like asking a musician to use his music for free. And some musicians will do it for "the exposure", because they want the gig credit to list on their website more than they want the money. But at some point, the band needs to be paid, or else they break up and great music goes unplayed.</p>

<p>Just sayin'.</p>
