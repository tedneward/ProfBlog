<p>I'm excited to say that TechEd has accepted my pre-conference proposal, <em>Multiparadigmatic C#</em>, where the abstract reads:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C# has grown from “just” an object-oriented language into a language that is capable of expressing several different paradigms of software development: object-oriented, functional, and dynamic. In this session, developers will learn how to approach programming in C# to use each of these approaches, and when.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If you're interested in seeing C# used in a variety of different ways, come on out.</p>  <p>And if you're not going to <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/?CR_CC=100280254&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;CR_SCC=100280254&amp;fbid=xvt_cg-ExsG" target="_blank">TechEd</a>.... why not? It's in New Orleans, folks!</p>
