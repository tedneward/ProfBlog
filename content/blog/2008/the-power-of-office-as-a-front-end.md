<p>I recently had the pleasure of meeting Bruce Wilson, a principal with iLink, and we had a pleasant conversation about enterprise applications and trends and such. Last week, in the middle of my trip to <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/europe/index.html">Prague</a> and <a href="http://jazoon.com/">Zurich</a>, he sent me a link to a blog entry he'd written on <a href="http://bruminations.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/enterprise-meet-mashups-user-experience-20-via-soa-and-obas/">using Office as a front-end</a>, and it sort of underscored some ideas I've had around Office in general. </p>

<p>The interesting thing is, most of the ideas he talks about here could just as easily be implemented on top of a Java back-end, or a Ruby back-end, as a .NET back-end. Office is a tool that many end-users "get" right away (whether you agree with Microsoft's user interface metaphors or not, or even <em>like</em> the fact that Office is one of the most widely-installed software packages on the planet), and it has a lot of support infrastructure built in. "Mashup" doesn't have to mean YouTube on your website; in fact, I dislike the term "mashup" entirely, since it sounds like something done in the heat of the moment without any planning or thought (which is the antithesis of anything that goes--or should go--into the enterprise). Can we use the term "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288452.aspx">cardinality</a>" instead? Please?</p>
