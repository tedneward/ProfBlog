<p>The full list is <a href="http://www.noop.nl/2008/09/top-100-blogs-for-development-managers-q3-2008.html">here</a>. It's a pretty prestigious group--and I'm totally floored that I'm there next to some pretty big names.</p> <p>In homage to Ms. Sally Fields, of so many years ago... "You like me, you really like me". Having somebody come up to me at a conference and tell me how much they like my blog is second on my list of "fun things to happen to me at a conference", right behind having somebody come up to me at a conference and tell me how much they like my blog, except for that one entry, where I said something <em>totally</em> ridiculous (and here's why) ....</p> <p>What I find most fascinating about the list was the means by which it was constructed--the various calculations behind page rank, technorati rating, and so on. Very cool stuff.</p> <p>Perhaps it's trite to say it, but it's still true: readers are what make writing blogs worthwhile. Thanks to all of you.</p>
